# A Formalized Lambek Calculus in Higher Order Logic \(HOL4\)

based on an implementation of Lambek Calculus in *Coq proof assistant* by **Houda ANOUN** and **Pierre CASTERAN** in 2003.

The following is a brief listing of what's available in the distribution:

-   Holmakefile: Makefile for building the HOL theories

-   LambekScript.sml: Basic definitions and theorems of Lambek Calculus

-   CutFreeScript.sml: Properties of “cut-free” sequent proofs

-   ExampleScript.sml: Some examples
